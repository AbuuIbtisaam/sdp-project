  <h2 align="center" style="color:white;">What Is Astrology?</h2>
  <p align="center" style="color:white;">Astrology is a pseudoscience that is based on the superstitious belief that the movement of the planets, sun, moon and constellations determines a person's fate. Astrology maintains that each person is born under a particular sign of the zodiac. A zodiac sign is based on the constellation that is most prominent in the night sky in any given month.

Astrologers use mathematics and other tools to calculate the course of various astronomical bodies and determine how these movements will affect a person's daily life and future.</p>
    <h2 align="center" style="color:white;">Is Astrology a Science?</h2>
    <p align="center" style="color:white;">Even though astrologers use mathematics and astronomy to make their calculations, their work belongs to the same pseudoscientific fields as cryptozoology, phrenology and numerology. There is no evidence that astrological predictions are accurate. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence to the contrary.</p>
   <h2 align="center" style="color:white;">Purposes of astrology</h2>
    <p align="center" style="color:white;">The original purpose of astrology, on the other hand, was to inform the individual of the course of his life on the basis of the positions of the planets and of the zodiacal signs (the 12 astrological constellations) at the moment of his birth or conception.</p>
    <h2 align="center" style="color:white;">Astrology in modern times</h2>
    <p align="center" style="color:white;">In countries such as India, astrology manages to retain here and there its position among the sciences. Its continued legitimacy is demonstrated by the fact that some Indian universities offer advanced degrees in astrology.</p>

    <p align="center" style="color:white;">Astrology is a study of the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies interpreted as having an influence on human affairs and the natural world. Astrology has been practiced for thousands of years and is deeply ingrained in many cultures and traditions. Despite its longevity and popularity, astrology remains a controversial subject with many skeptics and critics who challenge its validity and efficacy.</p>
    <h2 align="center" style="color:white;">What is it Based on?</h2>
    <p align="center" style="color:white;">Astrology is based on the belief that there is a correlation between celestial events and earthly occurrences. Astrologers analyze the positions of planets, stars, and other celestial bodies to make predictions about future events, understand personality traits and characteristics, and gain insight into the past. The positions and movements of celestial bodies are believed to have an impact on the lives and destinies of individuals and nations.</p>
    <h2 align="center" style="color:white;">Western Astrology</h2>
    <p align="center" style="color:white;">Western astrology is based on the twelve zodiac signs, each of which is associated with a specific date range and set of personality traits. The twelve signs are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. An individuals date of birth determines their zodiac sign, and astrologers use this information to make predictions and assessments about the individual's personality, relationships, and future.</p>
    <h2 align="center" style="color:white;">Vedic Astrology</h2>
    <p align="center" style="color:white;">Vedic astrology, on the other hand, is based on the positions of the planets at the time of a persons birth. Vedic astrology uses a different set of zodiac signs and also takes into account the lunar calendar. Vedic astrology is believed to be more precise and accurate than Western astrology, as it takes into account a wider range of factors.</p>
    <h2 align="center" style="color:white;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p align="center" style="color:white;">In conclusion, astrology is a fascinating and complex subject that has captured the attention of people for thousands of years. While its validity remains a subject of debate, astrology continues to hold a prominent place in many cultures and traditions around the world. Whether or not one believes in the power of astrology, there is no denying its enduring popularity and influence on human culture and society.</p>
